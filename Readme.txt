=============This repository has below folder structure===========
After downloading given file we have saved in subfolder /input_file
Pyspark has hadoop dependency so that is inside subfolder hadoop-3.3.6
Also Pyspark has JVM dependency which we have indicated in the program
by attaching that path to environment variable
During Pyspark processing partition file gets saved inside subfolder processed_data
Final output file gets saved inside subfolder output_file
For Remote TiDB Cloud connection security certificate needed, that is 
inside subfolder ssl_certificate
DatapipelineAmazon

=========Additional Notes related to Hadoop Dependency=============
Pyspark needs Hadoop but it works easily in Unix but not in Windows machine.
1st we have to download the Hadoop windows utility from below url
https://github.com/cdarlint/winutils,
Then we extract zip file and utilize hadoop-3.3.6 folder
After that to give requisite permission to Hadoop winutils we have to use below command
in Command prompt through admin user.
My project path is:D:\Python-Projects\DatapipelineAmazon
D:\Python-Projects\DatapipelineAmazon\hadoop-3.3.6\bin>winutils.exe chmod 777 D:/Python-Projects/DatapipelineAmazon


=========This repository has 2 Python file and "All SQL commands.txt"=============
I have not purposefully linked both the python program because better to do individual testing.

---1st run the Pysparkcsvprocessing.py----
It utilizes Pyspark package to do all cleaning and transformation steps.
During Pyspark processing partition file gets saved in processed_data
Then we join all parttion chunks and create Final output file which gets saved in output_file.
During processing initially it shows input file schema, 1st 5 rows, file total line count.
We are doing deduplication based on review_id column, it prints the duplicate review_id
values in console, then it shows post-deduplication line counts.
Then it does all further processing as required.

---2nd run the remotedbinsertcsv.py----
Through this the cleaned output file data gets loaded into remote TiDB Cloud database.
We have to create a TiDB Cloud database account first and create a test database.
We have to also check whether our computer IP address is added in their allow list/firewall rule.
We need to download the security certificate as per their instruction and save in local machine.
We create a dictionary mapping of MySQL datatypes and Pandas datatypes
That we utilize to programmatically create a Create Table statement
and then do Insert via batches with parameterized SQL.

---3rd we can check/test All SQL commands.txt----
This file has various SQL statements which I have prepared 
to analyze the data as per requirement.




=========== Pysparkcsvprocessing.py run console prints =====================

French talks about energy, form, mechanism, and economy in natural and man-made things. He compares birds to planes in terms of fuel-capacity, energy conversion efficiency, drag, etc. He compares suspension bridges and dinosaurs. He provides examples of neat inventions and the thought that has gone into them (every- thing from steam-catapults to toy cars to grommets). This is &quot;How Things Work&quot; for the non-moron crowd.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

My mother wrote this one. Many of the pieces featured in the book are part of my collection. But it's still the ONLY book on Harker Pottery, America's Oldest Pottery. This book not only includes beautiful pictures of Harkerware, but also includes a price guide and some history of the pottery industry of the Ohio Valley. Harker is a contemporary of many currently collectible potteries such as Hall and Homer Laughlin. While not as valuable currently as Autumn Leaf or Fiestaware, Harker's Cameoware is becoming increasingly popular. Harker is also the only manufacturer of ceramic serving forks and spoons as well as beautiful ceramic rolling pins|
